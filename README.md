# bikesharing

## Purpose 

This analysis uses visualizations of data from New York City to demonstrate to investors that a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The following visualizations have been created using Tableau Public and can be accessed for further analysis by following this [link to the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.krieger/viz/bikesharingchallenge_16644884235890/KeyOutcomes?publish=yes "link to the dashboard").

## Results

* Almost 150,000 rides lasted five minutes. At thirty-eight minutes, the number of rides decreases under 10,000. Only a very small number of rides laster over an hour. 

* Both male and female riders peak at five minute rides. Riders that did not identify their gender had a much more even distribution. Note that riders of unknown gender are by and large non-subscribers.

* Days with the highest number of Citi Bike rentals for non-subscribing customers fall on weekends while subscribers tend to use the service heavily throughout the entire week with Thursday being the peak day for number of rentals.

* A large majority of Citi Bike users are subscribers.

* On weekdays, bike rental times are highest from 7-9 A.M. and 5-7 P.M. while Saturday and Sunday have bike rental times spread out throughout the midday.

* While more males tend to rent Citi Bikes, the distribution of trips throughout the week is very similar, even down to the hour.

* The top three bikes were ridden over 450 times in the one month analyzed alone. The data shows easily which bikes receive the most use by bike id and which may need to receive maintenance.

## Summary

The majority of Citi Bike users are subscribers. Repeat business will be important for making this program work in Des Moines, so pushing subscriptions will be key.

Much like trips were broken down for each weekday and each hour by gender, the analysis team recommends a chart breaking down user vs subscriber trips by weekday and hour to determine more precisely the needs of the userbase.

Additionally, for further understanding maintenance needs, it is recommended to consider each bike's trip duration.
